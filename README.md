# electionanalysis---updated

##Project Overview
Election audit of local congressional election in Colorado conducted in two parts: a candidate analysis and a county analysis

# Part #1: Candidate Analysis
#First we calculated the total number of votes cast. 
#Then we compiled a list of all candidates who had received votes.
#Next we found the total number of votes received by each candidate. 
#Afterwards, we found the percentage of votes each candidate won.
#Finally we determined the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

# Part #2: County Analysis
#First we compiled a list of all counties where votes were cast.
#Following that, we found the total number of votes by county. 
#Finally, we determined the county that had the largest turnout of voters.
